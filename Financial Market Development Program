 The Financial Market Development Program (FMDP) is a series of interventions designed to develop the financial markets of Bhutan using the
 modality of a Policy Based Loan (PBL) with programmatic approach. The program identified three selected areas as outputs to address identified
 causes to solve the core problem of efficient financial intermediation, viz improved non-banking financial sector, strengthened stability and integrity
 of the financial system and improved financial inclusion. The project has three subprograms (SP) with linked policy actions. Following on what has
 been achieved in the previous program and discussions with the government , new areas were added under a SP3 within the same FMDP. SP1 has
 already been delivered. We ae seeking board approval for SP2 which was outlined at the time of SP1, and the additional SP3. A revised post program
 engagement framework too has been included to ensure the sustainability and continued success of the policy actions.
 The program supports key policy reforms designed to address identified deficiencies, vulnerabilities, and inadequate inclusiveness in the finance
 sector, while drawing lessons from previous programs of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The program will help address the three key binding
 constraints on the finance sector: (i) underdeveloped nonbank financial institutions, (ii) deficient financial infrastructure, and (iii) the combined
 effects of low financial literacy and inadequate financial inclusion. The program aims to strengthen the finance sector's resource mobilization to
 improve its allocative efficiency and to enhance stability and inclusiveness at the request of the Government of Bhutan.
 Macroeconomic stability achieved, economic diversity and productive capacity enhanced, and poverty eradicated, and inequality reduced
